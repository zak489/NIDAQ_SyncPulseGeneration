# NIDAQ_SyncPulseGeneration
The repositiory is designed to facillitate synchronize digital (and hopefully analog) pulse generation from a NIDAQ card, for both cases where it uses the internal clock or external trigger to synchronize the output. The pulse synthax would ideally follow that from the Swabian pulse streamer to enable seemless transitions.
